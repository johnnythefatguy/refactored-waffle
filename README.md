Python Virtual Assistant

Currently only got it to work on Arch, have not tried to run on debian systems. Windows requires you to have C++ tools version 14. Currently making this bot to help with my home lab. Right now its barebones with minimal features. But be my guest to take what I have so far and use as a template. If you add anything cool or have any ideas let me know.
