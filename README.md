Python Virtual Assistant

Currently only got it to work on Arch, have not tried to run on debian systems. Windows requires you to have C++ tools version 14. Currently making this bot to help with my home lab. Right now its barebones with minimal features. But be my guest to take what I have so far and use as a template. If you add anything cool or have any ideas let me know.

Right now the script assumes that you cloned the repo to the home folder and the profile name is the same as the bot's. This may change in future but until then change the exists check in the script if you need to.
